# CIS320HumanComputerAccessibilityProject
This project will serve as a semester long effort to create a web-cam tracking software. The purpose is to test different ways for a person to interact with their personal computer or phone, using a different interface, beyond the standard touch interfaces such as a mouse, mousepad, or keyboard; instead we will use retinal tracking.
